For our experiments we used a program by Harish Mohan Raj who provided it in a nice tutorial:  Function Calling and Code Interpretation with OpenAI's Assistant API: A Quick and Simple Tutorial   
The program is a simple wrapper for a version of the math tutor named “Code Generator” that includes a function to executing code with data fetched from the internet.
